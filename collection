Asking the user for input example:

current_time = input("what is the current time (in hours 0--23)?")
wait_time = input("How many hours do you want to wait")

print(current_time)
print(wait_time)

final_time = current_time + wait_time
print(final_time)

Example of using input, integer, and string variables:

n = input("What time is it now (in hours)?")
n = int(n)
m = input("How many hours do you want to wait?")
m = int(m)
sum_time = n + m
time_of_day = sum_time % 12
print("The time is now", time_of_day)

Example of a Dice Roll:

import random

prob = random.random()
print(prob)

diceThrow = random.randrange(1,7)       # return an int, one of 1,2,3,4,5,6
print(diceThrow)

module
A file containing Python definitions and statements intended for use in other Python programs. The contents of a module are made available to the other program by using the import statement.

Using the import random to pick 10 numbers between 25 35:

import random

howmany = 10
for counter in range(howmany):
    arandom = random.randrange(25,35)
    print(arandom)
    
Turtle exercise, drawing on the screen:

import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")
tess = turtle.Turtle()
tess.color("blue")
tess.shape("turtle")

dist = 5
tess.up()                     # this is new
for _ in range(30):    # start with size = 5 and grow by 2
    tess.stamp()                # leave an impression on the canvas
    tess.forward(dist)          # move tess along
    tess.right(24)              # and turn her
    dist = dist + 2
wn.exitonclick()

Printing a statement 100 times:

for _ in range(100):
    print("We like Python's turtles!")

Drawing Shapes:

# draw an equilateral triangle
import turtle

wn = turtle.Screen()
norvig = turtle.Turtle()

for i in range(3):
    norvig.forward(100)

    # the angle of each vertice of a regular polygon
    # is 360 divided by the number of sides
    norvig.left(360/3)

wn.exitonclick()

Using the len function:

The len function, when applied to a string, returns the number of characters in a string.

fruit = "Banana"
print(len(fruit))

alist =  ["hello", 2.0, 5]
print(len(alist))
print(len(alist[0]))

Slicing:

singers = "Peter, Paul, and Mary"
print(singers[0:5])
print(singers[7:11])
print(singers[17:21])

Slicing on a List:

a_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
print(a_list[1:3])
print(a_list[:4])
print(a_list[3:])
print(a_list[:])

Using Count:

a = "I have had an apple on my desk before!"
print(a.count("e"))
print(a.count("ha"))

Using Index:

music = "Pull out your music and dancing can begin"
bio = ["Metatarsal", "Metatarsal", "Fibula", [], "Tibia", "Tibia", 43, "Femur", "Occipital", "Metatarsal"]

print(music.index("m"))
print(music.index("your"))

print(bio.index("Metatarsal"))
print(bio.index([]))
print(bio.index(43))

Using Split:

song = "The rain in Spain..."
wds = song.split()
print(wds)

Using Split and a delimiter:

song = "The rain in Spain..."
wds = song.split('ai')
print(wds)

Using Join:

wds = ["red", "blue", "green"]
glue = ';'
s = glue.join(wds)
print(s)
print(wds)

print("***".join(wds))
print("".join(wds))

Lists and for loops:

fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "cherry"]

for afruit in fruits:     # by item
    print(afruit)

Generating a sequence to Iterate Over:

print("This will execute first")

for _ in range(3):
    print("This line will execute three times")
    print("This line will also execute three times")

print("Now we are outside of the for loop!")

Using Loops for the Turtle:

import turtle            # set up alex
wn = turtle.Screen()
alex = turtle.Turtle()

for aColor in ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue"]:
    alex.color(aColor)
    alex.forward(50)

The Accumulator Pattern:

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
accum = 0
for w in nums:
    accum = accum + w
print(accum)





print("range(5): ")
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

print("range(0,5): ")
for i in range(0, 5):
    print(i)

# Notice the casting of `range` to the `list`
print(list(range(5)))
print(list(range(0,5)))

# Note: `range` function is already casted as `list` in the textbook
print(range(5))


    

accum = 0
for w in range(11):
    accum = accum + w
print(accum)

# or, if you use two inputs for the range function

sec_accum = 0
for w in range(1,11):
    sec_accum = sec_accum + w
print(sec_accum)



Count the number of characters in string str1. Do not use len(). Save the number in variable numbs:

str1 = "I like nonsense, it wakes up the brain cells. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living."
numbs=0
for i in str1:
    numbs+=1
print(numbs)



Create a list of numbers 0 through 40 and assign this list to the variable numbers. Then, accumulate the total of the list’s values and assign that sum to the variable sum1:

numbers = (range(0, 41))
sum1 = 0
for w in numbers:
    sum1 = sum1 + w
print(sum1)

Indexing with Loops:

fruits = ['apple', 'pear', 'apricot', 'cherry', 'peach']
for n in range(len(fruits)):
    print(n, fruits[n])

Nested Iteration: Image Processing:

#In the example below, we first create a pixel with 45 units of red, 76 units of green, and 200 units of blue. We then print the current amount of red, change the amount of red, and finally, set the amount of blue to be the same as the current amount of green.

import image

p = image.Pixel(45, 76, 200)
print(p.getRed())
p.setRed(66)
print(p.getRed())
p.setBlue(p.getGreen())
print(p.getGreen(), p.getBlue())

Boolean values are true or false.

(You can also use "not in") The "in" operator tests if one string is a subtring of another:

print('p' in 'apple')
print('i' in 'apple')
print('ap' in 'apple')
print('pa' in 'apple')

#Recipe for Reading and Processing a File
Here’s a foolproof recipe for processing the contents of a text file. If you’ve fully digested the previous sections, you’ll understand that there are other options as well. Some of those options are preferable for some situations, and some are preferred by python programmers for efficiency reasons. In this course, though, you can always succeed by following this recipe.

#1. Open the file using with and open.

#2. Use .readlines() to get a list of the lines of text in the file.

#3. Use a for loop to iterate through the strings in the list, each being one line from the file. On each iteration, process that line of text

#4. When you are done extracting data from the file, continue writing your code outside of the indentation. Using with will automatically close the file once the program exits the with block.

fname = "yourfile.txt"
with open(fname, 'r') as fileref:         # step 1
    lines = fileref.readlines()           # step 2
    for lin in lines:                     # step 3
        #some code that references the variable lin
#some other code not relying on fileref   # step 4
However, this will not be good to use when you are working with large data. Imagine working with a datafile that has 1000 rows of data. It would take a long time to read in all the data and then if you had to iterate over it, even more time would be necessary. This would be a case where programmers prefer another option for efficiency reasons.

This option involves iterating over the file itself while still iterating over each line in the file:

fname = "yourfile.txt"
with open(fname, 'r') as fileref:         # step 1
    for lin in fileref:                   # step 2
        ## some code that reference the variable lin
#some other code not relying on fileref   # step 3


#Writing into a file

filename = "squared_numbers.txt"
outfile = open(filename, "w")

for number in range(1, 13):
    square = number * number
    outfile.write(str(square) + "\n")

outfile.close()

infile = open(filename, "r")
print(infile.read()[:10])
infile.close()

#Writing to a .csv file

olympians = [("John Aalberg", 31, "Cross Country Skiing"),
             ("Minna Maarit Aalto", 30, "Sailing"),
             ("Win Valdemar Aaltonen", 54, "Art Competitions"),
             ("Wakako Abe", 18, "Cycling")]

outfile = open("reduced_olympics.csv", "w")
# output the header row
outfile.write('Name,Age,Sport')
outfile.write('\n')
# output each of the rows:
for olympian in olympians:
    row_string = '{},{},{}'.format(olympian[0], olympian[1], olympian[2])
    outfile.write(row_string)
    outfile.write('\n')
outfile.close()

#There are a few things worth noting in the code above.

#First, using .format() makes it really clear what we’re doing when we create the variable row_string. We are making a comma separated set of values; the {} curly braces indicated where to substitute in the actual values. The equivalent string concatenation would be very hard to read. An alternative, also clear way to do it would be with the .join method: row_string = ','.join(olympian[0], olympian[1], olympian[2]).

#Second, unlike the print statement, remember that the .write() method on a file object does not automatically insert a newline. Instead, we have to explicitly add the character \n at the end of each line.

#Third, we have to explicitly refer to each of the elements of olympian when building the string to write. Note that just putting .format(olympian) wouldn’t work because the interpreter would see only one value (a tuple) when it was expecting three values to try to substitute into the string template. Later in the book we will see that python provides an advanced technique for automatically unpacking the three values from the tuple, with .format(*olympian).

#As described previously, if one or more columns contain text, and that text could contain commas, we need to do something to distinguish a comma in the text from a comma that is separating different values (cells in the table). If we want to enclose each value in double quotes, it can start to get a little tricky, because we will need to have the double quote character inside the string output. But it is doable. Indeed, one reason Python allows strings to be delimited with either single quotes or double quotes is so that one can be used to delimit the string and the other can be a character in the string. If you get to the point where you need to quote all of the values, we recommend learning to use python’s csv module.

This can be seen in the final example below. In this case, since “cherries” is not a key, return 0 (instead of None).

#When to use a dictionary: Now that you have experience using lists and dictionaries, you will have to decide which one is best to use in each situation. The following guidelines will help you recognize when a dictionary will be beneficial:

#When a piece of data consists of a set of properties of a single item, a dictionary is often better. You could try to keep track mentally that the zip code property is at index 2 in a list, but your code will be easier to read and you will make fewer mistakes if you can look up mydiction[‘zipcode’] than if you look up mylst[2].

#When you have a collection of data pairs, and you will often have to look up one of the pairs based on its first value, it is better to use a dictionary than a list of (key, value) tuples. With a dictionary, you can find the value for any (key, value) tuple by looking up the key. With a list of tuples you would need to iterate through the list, examining each pair to see if it had the key that you want.

#On the other hand, if you will have a collection of data pairs where multiple pairs share the same first data element, then you can’t use a dictionary, because a dictionary requires all the keys to be distinct from each other.

#A return statement, once executed, immediately terminates execution of a function, even if it is not the last statement in the function. In the following code, when line 3 executes, the value 5 is returned and assigned to the variable x, then printed. Lines 4 and 5 never execute. Run the following code and try making some modifications of it to make sure you understand why “there” and 10 never print out.

#Bonus challenge for studying: After you look at the explanation below, stop looking at the code – just the description of the function above it, and try to write the code yourself! Then test it on different lists and make sure that it works. But read the explanation first, so you can be sure you have a solid grasp on these function mechanics.

#First, an English plan for this new function to define called longer_than_five:

#You’ll want to pass in a list of strings (representing people’s first names) to the function.

#You’ll want to iterate over all the items in the list, each of the strings.

#As soon as you get to one name that is longer than five letters, you know the function should return True – yes, there is at least one name longer than five letters!

#And if you go through the whole list and there was no name longer than five letters, then the function should return False.

def longer_than_five(list_of_names):
    for name in list_of_names: # iterate over the list to look at each name
        if len(name) > 5: # as soon as you see a name longer than 5 letters,
            return True # then return True!
            # If Python executes that return statement, the function is over and the rest of the code will not run -- you already have your answer!
    return False # You will only get to this line if you
    # iterated over the whole list and did not get a name where
    # the if expression evaluated to True, so at this point, it's correct to return False!

# Here are a couple sample calls to the function with different lists of names. Try running this code in Codelens a few times and make sure you understand exactly what is happening.

list1 = ["Sam","Tera","Sal","Amita"]
list2 = ["Rey","Ayo","Lauren","Natalie"]

#Function to count length

#Well, actually, not that much harder. Now that we know how to define functions, we could define len ourselves if it did not exist. Previously, we have used the accumlator pattern to count the number of lines in a file. Let’s use that same idea and just wrap it in a function definition. We’ll call it mylen to distinguish it from the real len which already exists. We actually could call it len, but that wouldn’t be a very good idea, because it would replace the original len function, and our implementation may not be a very good one.

def mylen(seq):
    c = 0 # initialize count variable to 0
    for _ in seq:

#Let’s use composition to build up a little more useful function. Recall from the dictionaries chapter that we had a two-step process for finding the letter that appears most frequently in a text string:

#Accumulate a dictionary with letters as keys and counts as values. See example.

#Find the best key from that dictionary. See example.

#Multiple assignment with unpacking is particularly useful when you iterate through a list of tuples. You can unpack each tuple into several loop variables. For example:

#We are now prepared to understand a more pythonic approach to enumerating items in a sequence. Python provides a built-in function enumerate. It takes a sequence as input and returns a sequence of tuples. In each tuple, the first element is an integer and the second is an item from the original sequence. (It actually produces an “iterable” rather than a list, but we can use it in a for loop as the sequence to iterate over.)

fruits = ['apple', 'pear', 'apricot', 'cherry', 'peach']
for item in enumerate(fruits):
    print(item[0], item[1])

#The pythonic way to consume the results of enumerate, however, is to unpack the tuples while iterating through them, so that the code is easier to understand.

#While Statement
    
#We can use the while loop to create any type of iteration we wish, including anything that we have previously done with a for loop. For example, the program in the previous section could be rewritten using while. Instead of relying on the range function to produce the numbers for our summation, we will need to produce them ourselves. To do this, we will create a variable called aNumber and initialize it to 1, the first number in the summation. Every iteration will add aNumber to the running total until all the values have been used. In order to control the iteration, we must create a boolean expression that evaluates to True as long as we want to keep adding values to our running total. In this case, as long as aNumber is less than or equal to the bound, we should keep going.

#Here is a new version of the summation program that uses a while statement.

#This pseudocode has no option to set moreItems to False, so it would run forever. In a grocery store, there’s a little plastic bar that you put after your last item to separate your groceries from those of the person behind you; that’s how the clerk knows you have no more items. We don’t have a “little plastic bar” data type in Python, so we’ll do the next best thing: we will use a price of zero to mean “this is my last item.” In this program, zero is a sentinel value, a value used to signal the end of the loop. Here’s the code:

def checkout():
    total = 0
    count = 0
    moreItems = True
    while moreItems:

#You can also use a while loop when you want to validate input; when you want to make sure the user has entered valid input for a prompt. Let’s say you want a function that asks a yes-or-no question. In this case, you want to make sure that the person using your program enters either a Y for yes or N for no (in either upper or lower case). Here is a program that uses a while loop to keep asking until it receives a valid answer. As a preview of coming attractions, it uses the upper() method which is described in String Methods to convert a string to upper case. When you run the following code, try typing something other than Y or N to see how the code reacts:

def get_yes_or_no(message):

#Earlier you learned how to use the format method for strings, which allows you to structure strings like fill-in-the-blank sentences. Now that you’ve learned about optional and keyword parameters, we can introduce a new way to use the format method.

#Sometimes, you may want to use the .format method to insert the same value into a string multiple times. You can do this by simply passing the same string into the format method, assuming you have included {} s in the string everywhere you want to interpolate them. But you can also use positional passing references to do this! The order in which you pass arguments into the format method matters: the first one is argument 0, the second is argument 1, and so on.

#For example,

# this works

#Write a function called checkingIfIn that takes three parameters. The first is a required parameter, which should be a string.

The third is an optional parameter called d that has a default value of {'apple': 2, 'pear': 1, 'fruit': 19, 'orange': 5, 'banana': 3, 'grapes': 2, 'watermelon': 7}. Write the function checkingIfIn so that when the second parameter is True, it checks to see if the first parameter is a key in the third parameter; if it is, return True, otherwise return False.

#But if the second paramter is False, then the function should check to see if the first parameter is not a key of the third. If it’s not, the function should return True in this case, and if it is, it should return False

#When we first introduced lists, we noted the existence of a method sort. When invoked on a list, the order of items in the list is changed. If no optional parameters are specified, the items are arranged in whatever the natural ordering is for the item type. For example, if the items are all integers, then smaller numbers go earlier in the list. If the items are all strings, they are arranged in alphabetic order.

L1 = [1, 7, 4, -2, 3]
L2 = ["Cherry", "Apple", "Blueberry"]

L1.sort()
print(L1)

#Reverse

#1. Sort the list, lst from largest to smallest. Save this new list to the variable lst_sorted.

lst = [3, 5, 1, 6, 7, 2, 9, -2, 5]

#If you want to sort things in some order other than the “natural” or its reverse, you can provide an additional parameter, the key parameter. For example, suppose you want to sort a list of numbers based on their absolute value, so that -4 comes after 3? Or suppose you have a dictionary with strings as the keys and numbers as the values. Instead of sorting them in alphabetic order based on the keys, you might like to sort them in order based on their values.

#First, let’s see an example, and then we’ll dive into how it works.

#First, let’s define a function absolute that takes a number and returns its absolute value. (Actually, python provides a built-in function abs that does this, but we are going to define our own, for reasons that will be explained in a minute.)

for y in L1:

#Now, we can pass the absolute function to sorted in order to specify that we want the items sorted in order of their absolute value, rather than in order of their actual value.

L1 = [1, 7, 4, -2, 3]

def absolute(x):
    if x >= 0:
        return x
    else:

L2 = sorted(L1, key=absolute)
print(L2)

#or in reverse order
print(sorted(L1, reverse=True, key=absolute))

#You will be sorting the following list by each element’s second letter, a to z. Create a function to use when sorting, called second_let. It will take a string as input and return the second letter of that string. Then sort the list, create a variable called sorted_by_second_let and assign the sorted list to it. Do not use lambda.

#In the code below, we are going to sort a list of fruit words first by their length, smallest to largest, and then alphabetically to break ties among words of the same length.

#For our first sort order, we want to sort the states in order by the length of the first city name. Here, it’s pretty easy to compute that property. states[state] is the list of cities associated with a particular state. So If state is a list of city strings, len(states[state][0]) is the length of the first city name. Thus, we can use a lambda expression:

states = {"Minnesota": ["St. Paul", "Minneapolis", "Saint Cloud", "Stillwater"],
          "Michigan": ["Ann Arbor", "Traverse City", "Lansing", "Kalamazoo"],
